# interval-sensitivity
Idea 1: Perform linear regression (LR). Then use MSE to compute upper and lower bounds on the prediction of the LR. Compute the Wasserstein distance of the upper and lower bounds.

Idea 2: Use Interval Predictor Models (IPM). Then same procedure as Idea 1.

Idea 3: Find an algorithm to get the experimental upper and lower bounds (i.e. no regression or prediction at all). Then same procedure as Idea 1.
